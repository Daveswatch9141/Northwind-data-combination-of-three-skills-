# Worksheet
This is a combination of three skill and tools to derive this visualization and insights.
First i had to create the database from the schema gotten i.e creating all the tables in the schema in a SQL database and appling the ETL method to extract ,transfer and load the data. After extracting the data values i saved as excel file so i can clean it in excel before transfering to the Sql database with the "insert" function.
After all that was done i had to join some tables to get some insights in need to derive on powerbi visualization, i did the joining using left join still on SQl.note that i could still join it on powerbi,but i did on SQL because i was already transfering the data values there already,so i typed the syntax to left join the tables..
When i was done with that i saved the file as sql database and type the syntax to bring out all the tables i joined ,copied all the value on the rows and columns and paste on a new excel sheet and save as excel file again.
Then the final stage was PowerBI, where i took the joined tables data that i saved on excel and design interactive visualizations with it.
